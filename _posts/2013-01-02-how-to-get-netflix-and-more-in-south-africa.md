My friend @<a href="https://twitter.com/rgcrichton">rgcrichton</a> recently told me about a pretty cool service called <a href="http://www.unotelly.com/unodns/">UnoDNS</a>&#8482;. This service allows you to access sites like Netflix (<a href="http://www.unotelly.com/unodns/channels">full channel list</a>) by using DNS hacks to trick sites into thinking you're based in the relevant county (more details <a href="http://help.unotelly.com/solution/categories/9628/folders/25813/articles/9425-how-does-unodns-work-">here</a>).

To set up the service, simply sign up <a href="http://www.unotelly.com/unodns/">here</a> (you get a week of service for free), then set up your computer using the appropriate tutorial <a href="http://help.unotelly.com/solution/categories/18721">here</a> (it doesn't really matter which DNS servers you choose). If you're a bit more tech savvy, I recommend configuring the DHCP server on your LAN to hand out your chosen DNS servers along with the IP addresses. The banner at the top of the <a href="http://www.unotelly.com/quickstart2/">quickstart page</a> will tell you if your setup is correct and what to do if it isn't.

Once you're set up with UnoDNS&#8482;, go to <a href="https://signup.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>, sign up (you get a month free) and start streaming :).

I have a 4mbps ADSL line and I've only seen the video buffer once in (many) hours of watching. I think this was due to a recent <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/12/24/netflix-outage/">Netflix outage<a/> though.

Enjoy!
