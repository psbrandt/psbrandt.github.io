In December last year I was lucky enough to attend the very first annual OpenMRS
World Summit in Singapore. The summit was held at Singapore Management University
(SMU), which has some of the best conference facilities I've experienced and is
situated in an incredibly convenient location.

There were two days of tutorials before the main conference started, some of which
I lead. Tutorial topics included *Health IT & OpenMRS: An Introduction*, *AngularJS & REST Web Services 101*,
*Extending & Customizing OpenMRS*, *Concept Management* and *Getting Data Out*.
I was in Singapore as an OpenMRS volunteer, so I also helped with various
logistical issues such as participant registration and setup and tear down of the
meeting rooms.

The summit was run in the typical [unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference)
style, in which particpants set the session topics. There was a mixture of session
types such as *birds of a feather*, *fishbowl*, *lightning talks* and *plenary*.

There was a strong focus on governance at this meeting, which really is necessary
for building an effective and sustainable community. Some of the sessions that
dealt with governance and strategy related topics were *Governance for the Future*,
*OpenMRS Strategy 2016* and individual strategy session for each strategic objective
defined in the [governance document](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/RES/DRAFT+OpenMRS+Community+Governance+Model).

I really enjoyed [Joaqu√≠n](https://twitter.com/jblaya) and [Jordan](https://twitter.com/jordan6633)'s
session on cloud computing for OpenMRS data analytics, my session on OpenMRS
Local Communtities (it's always great to get feedback and new input) and the
session on Clinical Decision Support.

Apart from all the great sessions, there were also activities planned for every
evening such as visits to Chinatown, Little India, Gardens By The Bay, Labrador
Nature Reserve and Clark Quay. During these activities it was great to meet lots of community
members I had never met in person before and to catch up with some I hadn't seen
in a while.

Overall it was an amazing experience and I would like to say a huge thank you to
[Michael](https://twitter.com/downey) for planning and running an exceptional
event and to the OpenMRS leadership for providing the funding that enabled me to
attend.
