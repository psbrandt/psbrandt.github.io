On a number of occasions I've accidentally hit ⌘Q instead of ⌘⇥ and closed the current application.

Do disable this "feature" we go to <strong>System Preferences >> Keyboard</strong>, choose <strong>Application Shortcuts</strong> in the left pane. Now, double click on the current keyboard shortcut for <em>Show Help Menu</em> and press ⌘Q to remap it.

Now, whenever you press ⌘Q by accident you'll just open the help menu instead of closing the application.

Also, <a href="http://macbiblioblog.blogspot.com/2005/05/special-key-symbols.html">this</a> is quite a useful reference for the special Mac keyboard symbols.
