I was looking for a URL shortener which I could host, which allowed for private access (for creating new short URLs) and which kept decent statistics about each URL. <a href="http://yourls.org/">YOURLS</a> does the trick. Just download the PHP scripts, create a MySQL database, edit <code>config.php</code> and visit the admin page and you're done.
